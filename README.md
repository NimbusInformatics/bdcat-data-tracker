# BioData Catalyst Tracker

> A web-based data tracker for submission process

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)**
- **[Cloud SDK CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud)**

### Environment variables

For local development, the `api` directory should have an `.env` file with the following:

| name                 | value     | description                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT |           | The Project ID for GCP                                        |
| SECRET_KEY           |           | The `SECRET_KEY` generated by Django                          |
| POSTGRES_DB          | `tickets` | The Postgres database name                                    |
| POSTGRES_USER        | `admin`   | The username of the Postgres User                             |
| POSTGRES_PASSWORD    |           | The password for the Postgres User                            |
| POSTGRES_HOST        |           | The external IP for the Compute Engine instance with Postgres |
| POSTGRES_PORT        | `5432`    | The port for the Postgres Database                            |

### Docker Compose

Docker is used to standardize the development enviornment

```
docker-compose up --build
```

This will spin up a Docker container to serve the app

> NOTE: This may take a several minutes

You should only need to build this once (or when you make changes to the `Dockerfile`).
Any subsequent runs do not require the `--build` flag

```
docker-compose up
```

### The Django Server

Docker Compose should start a Django server on [`http://0.0.0.0:8000/`](http://0.0.0.0:8000/).
The server uses the `env` file for configuration

## Deployment

We will be using [this guide to deploy to GCP](https://cloud.google.com/python/django/appengine#macos-64-bit)

### Instructions

**Ensure all prior setup is complete before continuing**

To prepare the project for deployment, run the following commands:

```
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

#### [Secrets Manager](https://cloud.google.com/python/django/appengine#create-django-environment-file-as-a-secret)

In GCP Secret Manager, you must create a secret called `django_settings`.
You can either upload the `.env` file or paste the secrets in there

#### Compute Engine

In the GCP Console, create a new Compute Engine instance with your desired configuration.

- Make sure you are deploying with the container image `marketplace.gcr.io/google/postgresql11`.
  - To ensure the database remains consistent between reboots, you must mount a volume to the instance and map it to `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.

#### App Engine

This repo has been configured to use GitHub Actions to deploy to App Engine on pushes to the `main` branch.
For this to work, you must have GitHub Secrets with the following:

| name       | description                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| PROJECT_ID | The Project ID for GCP                              |
| GCP_SA_KEY | The full service account key json exported from GCP |

Alternatively, can navigate to the `api` directory and run:

```
gcloud app deploy
```
